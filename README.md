Titanic Survival Prediction
"Predicting survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster using machine learning and data analysis."

This project analyzes passenger data from the Kaggle Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes.
It demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow â€” from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model building and evaluation.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

Key objectives:
Understand the dataset through statistical summaries and visual exploration.
Apply preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Train and compare multiple machine learning models.
Evaluate model performance and interpret results
